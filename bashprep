"""
Create the docker group if it does not exist: sudo groupadd docker
Add your user to the docker group: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated. You can also run newgrp docker to activate the changes to groups.
Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo: docker run hello-world
Note that adding a user to the docker group grants them root-level privileges to the system1. For more security, you can also run docker as a non-root user using rootless mode1.
